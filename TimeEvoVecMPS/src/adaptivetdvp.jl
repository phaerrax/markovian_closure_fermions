    bondconvergencemeasure(PH::AbstractProjMPO, state::MPS, bond::Integer)

Return a measure of the convergence for the bond dimension on the bond (`bond`, `bond+1`)
of the MPS `state` for a time-evolution determined by `PH`. See [1] for details.

    function adaptbonddimensions!(

    )

If necessary, enlarge the bond dimensions of the MPS `v`, so that it can dynamically and
inhomogeneously restructure itself as the complexity of the correlations grow during the
time evolution generated by `H` [1].
